# Time-Series-forecasting-with-XGBoost-and-SVR
  By leveraging machine learning models like Support Vector Regressor (SVR) and XGBoost, the project enables energy companies to generate highly accurate forecasts of energy consumption. This allows companies to better anticipate demand fluctuations and optimize their resource allocation accordingly.

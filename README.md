# Time-Series-forecasting-with-XGBoost-and-SVR
  By leveraging machine learning models like Support Vector Regressor (SVR) and XGBoost, the project enables energy companies to generate highly accurate forecasts of energy consumption. This allows companies to better anticipate demand fluctuations and optimize their resource allocation accordingly.


  
Preprocessing steps: 


* Acquire the dataset, in this case text file PJME_hourly.csv


Transformational steps:


* Identifying and interpolating the missing values. 
* Setting ‘Datetime’ to index.



Feature Creation:


* Add more features to visualize and understand patterns. (e.g. month, year, week)



Visualize Feature/Target Relationship:



* Explore relationships and patterns between features and target variable.




Check of Stationarity Using Hypothesis testing:


* Run a hypothesis test to check for stationarity with will determine the means of forecasting and modelling.




Splitting the data set:


* Split set to training and testing data set



Implement machine learning models:



* XG Boosting 
* Support Vector Regression




Evaluate the forecasting performance of machine learning models:



* Mean Absolute Percentage Error
* Mean Error
* Mean Absolute Error
* Mean Percentage Error
* Root Mean Squared Error
* Theil's U Statistics
